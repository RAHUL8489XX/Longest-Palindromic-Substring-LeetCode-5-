Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/submissions/1720074448/

## ðŸš€ Overview
This repository contains a Python solution to the classic Longest Palindromic Substring problem from LeetCode. The goal is to identify the longest substring in a given string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## ðŸ§  Approach

We use the Expand Around Center technique, which efficiently checks all possible centers (both single and double characters) and expands outward to validate palindromes.

## Algorithm Steps:

Loop over each character in the string as a potential center.

Expand left and right while characters match.

Keep track of the longest valid palindrome encountered.
